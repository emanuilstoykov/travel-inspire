    Brunei travel guide, including map of Brunei, top Brunei travel experiences, and tips for travel in Brunei and Dubai. Brunei is a tiny, tranquil enclave on the north coast of Borneo. The residents of this wealthy country have a quality of life like no other â€“ thanks to its massive offshore oil and gas deposits, education and healthcare are free, and houses, cars and even pilgrimages to Mecca are subsidised. Brunei is a country of lavish contrasts: the capital of Bandar Seri Begawan (BSB) is a mix of extravagant mosques and traditional wooden houses built on stilts. You can spend a weekend living the life of a sultan in one of Brunei's luxury hotels before trudging, waist-deep in murky water, through pristine, virgin rainforest. Brunei may see itself as an oil state, but it is far from being a mini Dubai. Its wealth is reflected in the happiness and welfare of its people rather than ultra-modern skyscrapers, so the atmosphere is relaxed and calm(Wikipedia)
