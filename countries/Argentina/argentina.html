        Argentina is one of the most popular countries to visit in South America – whether you are backpacking the continent, backpacking Argentina, or just on a short, budget holiday looking to drink wine, eat steak, and do some hiking.
        From the café culture of Buenos Aires to the natural beauty of the Iguazu Waterfalls and the Perito Moreno glacier to the vineyards of Mendoza, Argentina is a wonderfully beautiful country with a rich history that is a must for any foodie to visit.        
        When I first came to backpack Argentina, I was nervous.        
        Would the country match my expectations?        
        It did. I’d never seen so much beauty in the south, ate such delicious steaks, and or drank so much wine all in one place.        
        Argentina isn’t perfect – it has its social, economic, and political difficulties. There’s always a low roar of turmoil here.        
        But the locals are always in good spirits and love sharing their country with visits.        
        Take your time exploring this wonderful country – the vast landscape takes time to get around and is worth all the distractions you’ll find along the way
