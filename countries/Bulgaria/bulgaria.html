<p>
    Bulgaria is a mixture of old and new, Bulgaria gives travellers a chance to explore a vibrant and attractive part of the Balkans that boasts rich folklore traditions mixed with a variety of stimulating activities.

    Marketed as an affordable alternative to the Eurozone, Bulgaria draws more and more visitors to its ski-slopes each winter.
    
    Its long, sandy Black Sea beaches are becoming an increasingly popular summer destination.
    
    But there is much more to Bulgaria than its cheap resorts. Outside of the ski-season, Bulgaria’s mountains and forests make an exciting playground for hikers, trekkers, climbers, mountain-bikers and horse-riders.
    
    Nature-enthusiasts will find a vast range of flora and fauna, thanks to Bulgaria’s mix of continental, Mediterranean and steppe terrain, with birds, butterflies and bats being particularly numerous.
    
    And it’s well-worth exploring Bulgaria’s timber-framed heritage villages and historic towns, where you’ll find a lively mix of Ottoman mosques, Orthodox Churches and Roman ruins.
